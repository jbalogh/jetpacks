title: Create a New Blocker for the Current Bug

  <p>
    Adds an inline link to create a new bug that blocks the current bug.  Look
    for it under the "Depends On" input field.

    Inspired by a
    <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/55265">Greasemonkey script</a>
    that does the same thing, but everyone knows Jetpacks are cooler than
    Greasemonkeys.  Thanks to <a href="http://spindrop.us/">Dave Dash</a> for
    the original script and the cool beard.
